@Chapter 1:

@YourRoom:
My room is somewhat messy , filled with bottles, books, 
artifacts from many different Time Periods. 
Also a bed wich i haven't made, because i can do wathever the fuck i want.
There is also sofa and lots of bookshelfs.//

@Medbay:
The Room contains 2 Very advanced Medical Units wich 
can be used te analyze and heal almost all wounds. 
Most surgery or healing is done by the on board AI, 
because I don't really have a ship crew anymore. 
Mostly my fault really, I'm an asshole.//

@CargoHold:
Lots of crates, loading equipment including a crane 
and a hover pad to move thing around.
Obligitory smuggeling compartment added by your truly.
Some weapons lying around, you know... for safety.
Also there is a "bed" more of a recharging bay, on which my only other crew member 'sleeps'.
His Name is SoundWave, and you guessed it he's a robot as well, at least i think he is.
He doesn't really speak.
There are also some heavy ship cannon's Wave installed as well, and probably full of illegal upgrades.
The best kind of upgrades if u ask me.

//

@EngineRoom:
Lots of engines and stuff... i kinda know what it all is.
Time drive, some euuuuh weird glowing lights you know, engine stuff.//

@ExitRamp:
Better not open de exit door, while i'm in between Time periods.
Unless you want too be stuck in between time and space.//

@Bridge:
Ah the bridge, fully equiped with comfy, somewat used seats,
 a bunch of control panels.
The steering panel is at the front where the big window is.
Big red computer core in the middle wich is where the AI 'lives'.
She can project herself anyware on the ship, quite annoying really.
The only reason she hasn't left is because well, 
she is the ship she cant really go anywhere else.//
