@Control Panel:
As the alarms are going of everywhere, you shout.
"shut that noise off you already told me there is a time anomaly"

Chrono: 
just checking if you are awake sir, Wave has finished recharging and is on his way to the bridge.
You: 
Good than he can make himself usefull for once.
you hear a distorted version of your voice say "he can make himself usefull for once".
As you turn around, your staring at you own face reflected in the black screen that Wave has where his face should be.
He smacks the back of your head with his metal hand.
You:
You should really get a face next time we go shopping for gear, and a real voice box maybe.
You earn another slap to the back of your head.
You: 
Goddammit let me work.
Chrono: 
Captain, may I suggest not fighting with our only other team member.
You: 
No you may not.

Suddenly a huge explosion is heard.
as you see a TimeShip fly by, which looks more like a junkpile then a ship.

You: Time Pirates now??! Wave, go man the cannons i'll pilot the ship.
Wave: ...
Wave pushes you aside and takes control over the ship, points to the door.
You: FINE! I'll go man the cannons.

Chrono: 
Do you need something captain?
You:
Not really, ...
Chrono: 
Then why are you bothering me Captain?
You:

Chrono:
Captain, may i remind you what happened to the last crew?
And besides as far as my calculations show theirs nobody left who is willing to work with you.
You:
...well you didn't need to say it out loud...
*you leave heartbroken*

Chrono: 
Captian, it would seem you are dying.
You are slowly Disseapearing, which means someone must have traveled back in time and killed you.
You: 
When? and who? i didn't get any notifications from the time patrol HQ, about a time anomaly.
Chrono: 
The HQ is currently not broadcasting anything sir. I can't reach them on the communicator.
You: 
What?!! Than set course for the HQ, something must have happend.
Chrono: 
Before communication went down I recieved orders not to return to HQ untill further notice.
You: 
And why didn't you tell me this before?
Chrono: 
you were sleeping sir.
You: 
THAT DIDN'T STOP STOP YOU BEFORE, WHY SHOULD IT NOW!
Chrono: 
Yelling at me won't change anything sir, and i seem to have found the time anomaly.
you should go  to the bridge.
You: 
Don't tell me what tot do i'm the captain.
Chrono:
Fine, have fun dying then.
You: 
*muffeled* Smart-ass AI thinks he can boss me around.

@Heavy shipcannons:
*explosions and sparks everywhere*
You: 
Chrono why aren't you firing back with the normal laser cannons.
Chrono:
Because sir that's the first thing they destroyed. It seems they know the layout of the ship.
They are currently attacking our engine room, and I don't need to tell you what happens when the time drive get's damaged, captain.
You:
Yeah I know, been there done that.
Chrono:
You've flown another ship before?
You:
Uuuuuh,.... this isn't the time to talk about this, how do i use these heavy cannon's.
Chrono:
I don't know sit these aren't standard issue weapons they were installed by SoundWave.
But i believe you should try pressing buttons.
You:
At random?
Chrono:
Sir, your a trained time patroller figure it out.
You:
FINE, Then i hope this works
*Presses red button*
...nothing happend
*Presses blue button* 
*BOOOOOOOOOOOM*

@Time Drive:
You:
WAVE here is the repair kit, fix it quickly please. I rather not blow up and be tossed in between space and Time...again
Wave: 
... 'again?'
Wave repeats in your voice.
You:
Don't worry about it, I've just seen some shit. 
The thought of being stuck in between Time and space, send a shiver down your spine.
Chrono: 
Captain, are you ok?
You:
I'm fine. I...
*LOUD Noise and the engine screech en spark a bit*
Wave: 
*static noise* 'fixed it' 
You:
Are you sure I rather not blow up.
*Wave slaps the back of your head*
Wave:
'don't question' 'my skills'
Chrono:
Captain, it seems the Time drive is operational en the self repair function of the ship seems to be restored were ready to go.

@engines:
*you gaze at the engines*
You:
Maybe I should upgrade the engines.
Chrono:
Captain, please refrain from breaking my the engines again.
You:
But your my ship, don't you trust me with upgrading you.
Chrono:
I don't consent to this, and i don't trust you with my engines after the last fiasco of you trying to 'upgrade' me.
You:
...
Chrono:
Captain?
You:
...
Chrono:
Wave, i broke the captain.
You:
*mumbles* Even my own ship doesn't trust me...
*you walk away form the engines*
