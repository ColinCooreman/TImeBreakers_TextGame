The Year is 2238, in the last few years science has advanced rapidly.
Our greatest and most dangerous technology is Time Travel, 
a technology  that never should have been invented.  
It was outlawed almost immediately after it's invention, 
but it was too late people were already travelling through time.   
To keep the Timeline safe a organization  was created, 
this organization is called the Time Patrollers. 
Their job? To keep the timeline in check and see to it no drastic changes occur. 
Because even the smallest of changes to The timeline,
can have disastrous consequences.
I'm a Time Patroller and I have been for the past 10 years... or something like that.
I used to have quite a big crew on this ship, but being the charming asshole that i am.

Chrono is the on board AI so she can't really leave.
And Wave is a faceless robot who doesn't speak. 
He just plays back anything you say to him or anything he has recorded before.
Damn annoying if you ask me.
One tends to lose perspective of Time when travelling though it as much as I do.
