SoundWave just points to the door again.
You Don't want to get slapped on the head again so you decide to not bother him.

@SoundWave-CargoHold:
...
SoundWave seems to be tinkering with the heavy artillery of the ship.
You: Wave, what are you doing?
Wave: ...
Wave just seems to ingnore you
You: You know your really useless when it comes to conversating.
Wave:*static noise*
Then you hear a distorted recording of you voice say "you know your really useless"
You give him a deathglare but his face is a vizor so you just staring at yourself really.
You: *mumbles* stupid smartass faceless robot.
Wave: *static noise* "You know your really" *clicking noise* "stupid".
You: Why do i try to talk to you.
You earn a slap to the back of your head and Wave points to the door.
You: This is my ship, I can go to wherever I want.
As you dodge a second slap you realise talking to Wave might actually be a useless endeavour.

@SoundWave-EngineRoom:
...
Wave seems to be working on the Timedrive which seems to be damaged. The engines als seem to have taken some damage, 
thats probably why they are making weird noises an smoking a bit.
You: What can I do to help fix the ship wave?
Wave's head rotates towards you as a weird looking component appears on the screen i call his face.
Wave: "Make yourself usefull for once" *static noise* "Located" "In" "Cargohold" "Move quickly" *clicking noise*
Wave turns back to the timedrive and points to the door.
